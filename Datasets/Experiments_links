Here are the instructions to dowload and build up different datasets and reference databases.


##Simulated datasets

* sets of paired-end reads (setA2_1, setA2_2; setB2_1, setB2_2)
* a set of genomes 

### Sets of reads

The sets of simulated paired-end reads we used for experiments are downloadable from 
http://www.gardner-binflab.org/lindgreen-et-al-metagenomics-benchmark-data/

They were designed ad hoc for a benchmarking analysis of metagenomic tools by reproducing the size, complexity and characteristics of real metagenomic samples. 
Moreover, Lindgreen's datasets were designed to include subsets of simulated random shuffled reads in order to test the reliability of the classification.

We selected the sets setA2 (setA2_1, setA2_2) and setB2 (setB2_1, setB2_2) and we modified the content of each fasta file as follows. 

We took the random shuffled reads whose titles are in files title_setA2ran.txt.gz and title_setB2ran.txt.gz, respectively.
We removed from setA2 and from setB2 a group of reads associated with the phylum of Eukaryotes whose species provenance was not specified.
In addition, we preferred to discard also a group of reads whose associated genomes are expiring entries in the NCBI database being obsolete or incorrect. 
Each set of considered reads of setA2 and setB2 thus contains around 20 millions of sequences excluding the number of random shuffled reads. 
The list of reads taken into account in setA2 and setB2 is partitioned in files title_setA2_part_.gz* and title_setB2_part_.gz*, respectively.
To decompress them, one could use the command cat compressed.gz* | zcat > /path/to/decrompressed/file

### Reference database

The reference database comprises 930 genomes from 686 species belonging to 17 phyla as indicated in Lindgreen et al. https://www.nature.com/articles/srep19233 in the Supplementary Table S2.
In Reference_database.csv we report the accession number and the lineage for genome considered. 



##Real dataset

* a set of paired-end reads (SRR1804065)
* a set of genomes 

### Sets of reads

The real metagenome is a paired-end read collection from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP). It is a tool sample of a female participant downloadable from 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRR1804065

Since the "ground truth" is not available for a real metagenome and a large number of reads may belong to unknown species, we first filtered this dataset by using BLAST. The list of reads examined in SRR1804065 is in file title_SRR1804065.txt.gz.

### Reference database

The reference database we use for this experiment comprises 3,423 genomes from 1,499 species belonging to 42 phyla.
The list of their accession number is in Refs_SRR1804065.txt.
